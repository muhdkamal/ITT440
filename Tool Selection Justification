Tool Selection Justification: Siege

Siege was selected as the testing tool for this performance analysis due to several reasons:

1. Open-Source Tool

Siege is an open-source tool, which is completely free to use without any fees.Siege also allows users 
to modify the code and customize it according to their specific needs. This tool also provide transparency 
and continuous improvement through contributions from developers around the world.

2. Support for HTTP and HTTPS Testing

Siege is primarily designed for testing HTTP and HTTPS-based web servers, which makes it very suitable 
for testing the performance of web applications and services. This allows it to simulate multiple users 
making requests to the web server, which is very suitable for several test like stress test, load test,
and spike test.

3. Lightweight and Efficient

Siege is a lightweight tool that does not require significant system resources to operate due to the use of 
command line (CLI) instead of Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is ideal for quick tests with minimum resource, 
and it can easily handle scenarios with a high number of concurrent users. Siege offers essential features such 
as customizable delays between requests to simulate realistic user behavior.

4. Ease of Use

Siege is known for its beginner-friendly concept and ease of use. The command-line interface (CLI) allows users to perform
specific tests by providing several basic parameters, such as the number of concurrent users, test duration, and 
the target URL. Additionally, the tool provides clear output, making it easy to analyze results.
