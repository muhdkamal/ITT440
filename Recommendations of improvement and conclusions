Recommendations for Improvement

1. Enhanced the testing methodology
   - The previous breakpoint test only simulates '/delay/2', which means the test simulate 2 second of backend processing time. For
     the next test, delays should be varied, like some users experience 2 seconds of delay, some might face 3 seconds, and some might 
     face 5 seconds. Furthermore, the number of users should be increased maybe to hundreds or thousands of users to test the actual
     breakpoint limit.

2. Improve resource monitoring
   - For the next test, certain plugin, like JMeter PerfMon should be considered to be added into the test in order to capture the
     CPU, memory and disk resource allocation. Furthermore, the reporting section of the test could be enhanced more in the future,
     like generate comprehensive HTML reports with percentile analysis, such as 90 and 95th percentiles.

3. Network Optimization
   - For the next test, the wired connection should be considered to be used. As we know, the previous test used the internet connections 
     from the mobile hotspot, which might introduce some additional latency that could affect the test results. With wired connection, 
     the internet connection will be more stable, which can make the test's results to be more efficient. Furthermore, caching
     strategies are also part of improvement that could be done in the next test, which works by implementing caching mechanism for 
     frequent accessed points.
